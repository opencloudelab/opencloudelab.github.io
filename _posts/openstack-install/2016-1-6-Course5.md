##### Course 5: Configuring the Network #

###### VLAN Topology #

The two topologies above provide a brief overview of what the network should look like. Each node (Storage, HAProxy, Infras, Compute) will need to have certain connections that will allow for communication between it and other nodes. The bridges are labelled as br- and followed by the type of connection. Each bridge connects to the other nodes via their respective bridge connections. The second topology describes the difference between the VLAN bridge and the other 3. In this case the VLAN bridge has no subinterface between it and the external network. This is because the external physical network is not set up to direct that type of traffic.

The network interface settings that were used previously reside here:

In order to define the setting for VLAN, the following is required:

1. Netmask

2. Gateway

3. Dns-nameservers

In order to obtain the netmask, use:

```sh
$ route
```

The output to the command above should appear similar to as follows:

|Kernel IP routing table|
|----------------------------------|
|Destination  | Gateway  | Genmask  |  Flags  |  Metric  |  Ref |  Use  | Iface|
|default|10.241.254.253|0.0.0.0|UG|0|0|0|eth0|
|10.241.0.0|*|255.255.0.0|U|0|0|0|eth0|

In order to obtain the gateway, use:

```sh
$ ip r
```

The output will appear similar to as follows:


|default|via|10.241.254.253|dev|eth0
|------------------------------|
|10.241.0.0/16|dev|eth0|proto kernel|scope link|src| 10.241.1.55

  

In order to obtain the dns-nameserver, look into the following file:

```sh
$ vi /etc/resolv.conf
```

* * *

##### Interface settings:

Navigate to "/etc/network/interfaces" and edit it to resemble the file that follows this instruction:

```sh
$ cd /etc/network/interfaces
```
  

For reference, in the interface file eth0 is 1G and eth1 is 10G:

```sh
# The loopback network interface

auto lo

iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface

auto eth0

iface eth0 inet manual

# auto automatically brings the interface up at boot

auto eth1

iface eth1 inet manual

# the manual variable sets it so that the ip settings are not directly configured here, but rather will # be configured by external scripts or files

iface eth1.101 inet manual

 vlan-raw-device eth1

iface eth1.102 inet manual

 vlan-raw-device eth1

iface eth1.103 inet manual

 vlan-raw-device eth1

auto br-mgmt

iface br-mgmt inet static

 bridge_stp off # spanning tree protocol enables multiple bridges to work together

 bridge_waitport 0 # maximum wait time for specified ports to become available

 bridge_fd 0 # forwarding delay

 bridge_ports eth1.101

 address 10.20.20.2

 netmask 255.255.255.0

auto br-vxlan

iface br-vxlan inet manual

 bridge_stp off

 bridge_waitport 0

 bridge_fd 0

 bridge_ports eth1.102

 # On infra nodes, IP address is in neutron container

auto br-vlan

# the bridges for vlan, storage, and management are set to static in order to make their definitions # unchangeable by scripts and or

iface br-vlan inet static

 address 10.241.1.55

 netmask 255.255.0.0

 gateway 10.241.254.253

 dns-nameservers 10.241.1.1

 # Neutron tags this traffic with l3 headers

 bridge_stp off

 bridge_waitport 0

 bridge_fd 0

 bridge_ports eth0

auto br-storage

iface br-storage inet static

 bridge_stp off

 bridge_waitport 0

 bridge_fd 0

 bridge_ports eth1.103

 address 10.20.40.2

 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

The next set of steps involve bringing the recently configured network online and then checking the status. This is the part that will contain some debugging/error correction. &lt;We make a lot of assumptions here as to the experience of the reader.&gt;

Bring up interface eth1(10G):

```sh
$ ifup eth1
```

Check eth1 status with:

```sh
$ ip a s eth1
```

Bring up sub-interface (eth.101, 102, and 103):

```sh
$ ifup eth1.101
```

You should get 8021q module needed warning and system will add it to kernel:

  

The output for the command ``` $ ip a s eth1.101 ``` may appear as: 

For eth1.101:


*WARNING: Could not open /proc/net/vlan/config. Maybe you need to load the 8021q module, or maybe you are not using PROCFS??*

*Set name-type for VLAN subsystem. Should be visible in /proc/net/vlan/config*

*Added VLAN with VID == 101 to IF -:eth1:-*

The above warning only appears because this is the first time that the interface has been added. It is not anything to be concerned about.

  

The output below is similar to the output above except that it is missing the warning. Some interfaces may give a warning and others may not; but, as long as they indicate that they are added to the VID corresponding to their respective ethernet designation, eth1.102 in this case, then everything is fine. For eth1.102:

*Set name-type for VLAN subsystem. Should be visible in /proc/net/vlan/config*

*Added VLAN with VID == 102 to IF -:eth1:-*

  
  

The same is true here as above. This is just another example to display how the VID corresponds to the interface. For eth1.103:

*Set name-type for VLAN subsystem. Should be visible in /proc/net/vlan/config*

*Added VLAN with VID == 103 to IF -:eth1:-*
