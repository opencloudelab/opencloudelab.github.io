##### Course 6: Interface naming and 8021 module #

One of the things that you pay attention to is the naming of your interfaces. For instance, above we chose eth1.101, eth1.102, and eth1.103. These names are privately owned, meaning that once assigned, no other deployment should use these same names. This is important as if you double up on the names, the traffic will be confused and the systems will be effectively useless. If you do find that your deployment is using the same interface names as another deployment, the fix is easy. We simply edit the same interfaces file to have a slightly different name. For instance, if eth1.101is used, eth1.201can be used for the next cluster. Note that the first number in the ethernet interfaces name corresponds to its actual designation. Eth1.101 is ethernet interface 1 and needs to stay that way to communicate correctly.

Test all servers with the following command and verify that their state is up using the following command. The output should appear similar to what follows the command:

```sh
$ ip a
```
The output should appear similar to the following:

```sh

5: eth1.101@eth1: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default

 link/ether 90:e2:ba:00:26:14 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

 inet6 fe80::92e2:baff:fe00:2614/64 scope link

 valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

6: eth1.102@eth1: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default

 link/ether 90:e2:ba:00:26:14 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

 inet6 fe80::92e2:baff:fe00:2614/64 scope link

 valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

7: eth1.103@eth1: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default

 link/ether 90:e2:ba:00:26:14 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

 inet6 fe80::92e2:baff:fe00:2614/64 scope link

 valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

8021q module is necessary for sub-interface setup, check if it exists in your kernel:

```sh
$ lsmod | grep 802
```

The output should resemble the following:


|8021q|28933|0|
|---------|
|garp|14384|1| 8021q
|mrp|18778|1|8021q|
