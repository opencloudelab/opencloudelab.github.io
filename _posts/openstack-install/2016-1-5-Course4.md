#### Course 4: Creating partitions and logical volumes #

LVM Settings

In order to set up the storage node and containers, you need to determine the current condition of the node. You will ssh into the storage node as follows:

```sh
$ ssh root@10.241.1.54
```

Then, check current partitions available using:

```sh
$ fdisk -l
```

The above is a lowercase L. It will list the partitions for all devices unless you provide a 3rd argument, which would point fdisk to the specific device you desire to list the partitions of.

Next, use the following to display the current existing physical volumes:

```sh
$ pvdisplay
```

After you have found that there are no current physical volumes and have identified the hard drive partitions available, use the following command to create the physical volume:

```sh
$ pvcreate /dev/sdb1
```

Use the following command to view current partitions:

```sh
$ fdisk /dev/sdb
```

Traversing the help menu for fdisk will allow you to set up partitions, view partitions, delete partitions, or whatever else is necessary given your specific parameters. For creating new partitions, we chose to use the default settings rather than specify anything.

  

Then, you need to create your volume group, naming it "cinder-volumes":

```sh
$ vgcreate cinder-volumes /dev/sdb1
```

Finally, display the volume groups to ensure that your work was done correctly:

```sh
$ vgdisplay
```
