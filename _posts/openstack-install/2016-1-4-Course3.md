#### Course 3: Installing Distributed Shell and other infrastructure host packages #

* * *

Next, you will need to install "dsh" (Distributed Shell), which will allow you to send commands to several nodes at once, using the following command:

```sh
$ apt-get install dsh -y
```

After installing, "dsh"(Distributed Shell) is used to test the connection from Infras to other nodes using this procedure:

* Create a directory called group:

```sh
	$ mkdir -p /root/.dsh/group
```
* Create a file named "hosts" and use the editor of your choice to input the IP's for the hosts:

```sh
	$ vi /root/.dsh/group/hosts
```

  

Following the above steps, send the command "echo hi" to all IP's contained within the file "hosts" while showing their respective IP's in the CLI:

```sh
$ dsh -g hosts -c -M "echo hi"
```

After ensuring the communication to all hosts, you need to determine the kernel version of each host using:

```sh
$ dsh -c -g hosts -M 'uname -a' 
```

(This gives the kernel version)
(Side note-- if your kernel version is version 34 or less, it needs upgrading. otherwise, leave it alone)

You can then update all hosts, if needed:

```sh
$ dsh -c -g hosts -M "apt-get update"
```

Access the installation guide from Rackspace:docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/

After the update, you can install several packages needed for further work. If this or any other later steps fail, it may be because of the \ in the script. Simply delete the \ to see if that corrects the problem:

```sh
$ apt-get install aptitude build-essential git ntp ntpdate \
 openssh-server python-dev sudo
```

Next, you will install Ansible, which you will need to in order to install playbooks later on. Navigate to opt directory:

```sh
$ cd /opt
```

Then, acquire the openstack Ansible program found at their git repo:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible.git
```

Access the openstack-ansible folder:

```sh
$ cd openstack-ansible/
```

Execute the bootstrap-ansible.sh script to install Ansible:

```sh
$ ./scripts/bootstrap-ansible.sh
```

Verify Ansible version by:

```sh
$ ansible --version # (optional)
```

The following command installs several packages needed for the next steps (LVM and networking related) to all the hosts detailed in your previously defined "hosts" file:

```sh
$ dsh -c -g hosts -M "apt-get install bridge-utils debootstrap ifenslave ifenslave-2.6 lsof lvm2 ntp ntpdate openssh-server sudo tcpdump vlan -y"
```
