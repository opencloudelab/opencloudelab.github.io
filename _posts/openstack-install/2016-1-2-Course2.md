#### Course 2: Key pair creation and distribution #

* * *

##### Create key pairs. Key pairs are like the guest keys to your friend/family's house. For our case, we need to take the "public key" from all our infra nodes and copy them to all other nodes. Which would mean generating a public key for infra1, infra2, and infra3, copying those public keys to infra1, infra2, infra3, storage, compute, and the logging nodes. #

  

In this example, we use the following sequence of commands and instructions:

  

First, ssh into your infra 1, infra2, and infra3 nodes. This process will seem tedious:

```sh
$ ssh root@10.241.1.55 # or whatever your infra1 node ip is
$ cd .ssh # takes you to the ssh directory
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa # generates a key and saves it in rsa
```

After running the previous command you will see a strange box with characters in it. This is the public key that you will add to the authorized_keys file found it infra1. First verify its existence and then transfer it:

```sh
$ ls
$ ssh root@10.241.1.54 "echo '`cat -/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`' &gt;&gt; /.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

You will probably be prompted with a password request, but after completing the password, the command will execute. The above command prints the ssh public key found at /ssh/id_rsa.pub and appends the file/ssh/authorized_keys. This same operation is performed so that all infrastructure node keys reside on all other nodes. This means also appending the authorized_keys on each node with their own public key. The following is a copy paste version of the commands needed for each server to perform. Remember to change the ips to your respective ips:

  

```sh
$ ssh root@10.241.1.55
$ cd .ssh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
$ cat id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; authorized_keys
$ ssh root@10.241.1.54 “echo ‘`cat -/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`’ >> /.ssh/authorized_keys”
```

You will be prompted with a password request each time you execute this command.

```sh
$ ssh root@10.241.1.56 “echo ‘`cat -/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`’ >> /.ssh/authorized_keys”
```
