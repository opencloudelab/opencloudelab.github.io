#### Course 7: Configuring bridges, VLANS, and interfaces within #

Interface settings - bridges:

Next, you will need to create a series of bridges that allow communication to flow without conflict. For instance, a br-storage bridge can be created so that storage traffic, meaning requests or commands pertaining to cinder, to and from the storage node can be completed along that path. The same is true for each type of service on each node. The storage node's communications to the infrastructure node may go through the management bridge if the nature of the communication is networking service related. Once you have created each bridge that you will need, you will need to associate the bridges with certain VLANs so that they know what VLANs traffic is allowed on each respective bridge.

To Show all bridges on the network:

```sh
$ brctl show
```

  

To Activate the Bridge:

```sh
$ ifup br-mgmt
```

  

To check the status of a specific network construct:

```sh
$ ip a s br-mgmt
```

  

To check the configuration of all the bridges:

```sh
$ dsh -g hosts -M 'brctl show' # (Need to be ssh'ed into an Infra Node)
```

  

To ping from Infra node to various bridges:

```sh
$ ping -I br-storage 10.20.40.3
```

The above command pings from the first variable (br-storage) to 10.20.40.3 in order to verify communication. It does this ping along the br-storage bridge�s connections (veths). The source address gets changed to that of the address on br-storage.

Configure VLAN on Cisco Nexus Switch (Just for OCI)

You will need to ssh into the cisco switch, check the current VLANs that are created, and create your own VLAN using cisco command : vlan 101. After creating the VLAN, name it using: name br-mgmt, which in this case names it "br-mgmt".

Next, you will need to check which ports are currently associated with the VLAN (there may not be any), and associate the necessary ports. The series of commands that are required to perform these steps are defined in the tables below.

#####The following table corresponds to the switch ports and the interface designation.

 

|IP|10G|Nexus Switch Port|Mode|
|--------|
|10.241.1.54|eht1|Eth1/26|trunk|
|10.241.1.55|eht1|Eth1/27|trunk|
|10.241.1.56|eht2|Eth1/21|trunk|
|10.241.1.57|eth1|Eth1/18|trunk|
|10.241.1.58|eht1|Eth1/19|trunk|
|10.241.1.59|eth1|Eth1/17|trunk|


  
  
  
  
  

##### This table details the network for all nodes and bridges. #

| |Storage/Cinder|Infra 1|Infra 2|Infra3|Compute|Logging/HA Proxy|

|Server|10.241.1.54|10.241.1.55|10.241.1.56|10.241.1.57|10.241.1.58|10.241.1.59|
|Br-mgmt|10.20.20.6|10.20.20.2|10.20.20.3|10.20.20.7|10.20.20.4|10.20.20.5|

|Br-storage|10.20.40.6|10.20.40.2|10.20.40.3|10.20.40.7|10.20.40.4|10.20.40.5|

When privileges are elevated, you are allowed to go to a global configuration mode using:

```sh
$ config t
```

Then, use the command $ show vlan to display the current VLANs that are arranged on the switch. The exact sequence and arrangement of steps that follow depend entirely on the current configuration of the switch you are using.

To Delete an existing VLAN:
```sh
$ no vlan &lt;vlan-number&gt;
```

To create a new VLAN:

```sh
$ vlan <vlan-number>
```
  

To name the VLAN:

```sh
$ name <vlan-name>
```

To start the VLAN:

```sh
$ state active
$ no shutdown
```

  

To exit from this VLAN:

```sh
$ exit
```

  

To see interface status:

```sh
$ show interface brief
```

  

To configure a port to a VLAN you have to enter into that port number using the following:

```sh
$ interface ethernet <port-number> # (1/20 for example)
```

To eliminate the port from VLAN:

```sh
$ interface ethernet <port-number> # (1/20 for example)
$ no switchport mode trunk
```

You should set the port to trunk mode in order to have untagged traffic from outside the assigned port. If a port is not under trunk mode, you need to set a port mode using:

```sh
$ switchport trunk mode
```

  

To see specifications for a particular port number:

```sh
$ show running-config interface Ethernet <port-number> # (1/20 for example)
```
  

To remove a specific port from an interface:

```sh
$ no switchport trunk allowed vlan <port-number>
```

  

To add a specific port to the interface:

```sh
$ switchport trunk allowed vlan <port-number>
```

  

The following is an example of the series of commands that can be run to create a VLAN:

Creation of VLANs:

```sh
$ vlan 201 # Creates a VLAN with ID 201
$ name br-mgmt2 # Renames it br-mgmt2
$ state active # This tells the switch to make the VLAN active
$ no shutdown # This command tells the switch to turn on the VLAN
$ exit # Exits this interface

$ vlan 202 # Repeats the same process from above
$ name br-vxlan2
$ state active
$ no shutdown
$ exit

$ vlan 203
$ name br-storage2
$ state active
$ no shutdown
$ exit
```

Check interfaces' status:

```sh
$ show interface brief
```

If you check the configurations in the cisco switch and find that there are already some VLANs assigned to the naming convention that you used, then you will need to remove some of the ports from your VLANs and add others. The process for doing so is outlined here.

Remove interfaces 17, 19 from all VLANs associated with these ports

Interface 17

```sh
$ interface ethernet 1/17
$ no switchport mode trunk
```

Interface 19

```sh
$ interface ethernet 1/19
$ no switchport mode trunk
```

Associate new VLANs with all of the new physical switch ports (interfaces) connected to your nodes.

Interface 17

```sh
$ interface ethernet 1/17
# Remove unnecessary association of this interface from other VLANs.
# $ no switchport trunk allowed vlan <VLAN-number>
$ show running-config interface Ethernet 1/17
# If Interface 17 is not in trunk mode
# $ switchport mode trunk
$ switchport trunk allowed vlan 201-203
$ exit
```

Interface 18

```sh
$ interface ethernet 1/18
$ show running-config interface Ethernet 1/18
$ switchport trunk allowed vlan 201-203
$ exit
```

Interface 19

```sh
$ interface ethernet 1/19
$ show running-config interface Ethernet 1/19
$ switchport trunk allowed vlan 201-203
$ exit
```

Interface 21

```sh
$ interface ethernet 1/21
$ show running-config interface Ethernet 1/21
$ switchport mode trunk
$ switchport trunk allowed vlan 201-203
$ exit
```

Interface 26

```sh
$ interface ethernet 1/26
$ show running-config interface Ethernet 1/26
$ switchport mode trunk
$ switchport trunk allowed vlan 201-203
$ exit
```

Interface 27

```sh
$ interface ethernet 1/27
$ show running-config interface Ethernet 1/27
$ switchport mode trunk
$ switchport trunk allowed vlan 201-203
$ exit
```

To make the changes permanent:

```sh
$ copy running-config starting-config
```

To remove an association from VLAN interface

```sh
$ brctl delif br-vxlan eth1.102
```

  

To remove a VLAN interface

```sh
$ vconfig rem eth1.102
```

  

To bring down a bridge

```sh
$ ip link set br-vxlan down
```

  

To delete a bridge

```sh
$ brctl delbr <bridge-name>
```

  

Here is an example of the sequence of commands that can be used to reconfigure your bridges and VLANs:

```sh
$ brctl delif br-mgmt eth1.101 #deletes the eth1.101 interface from br-mgmt
$ vconfig rem eth1.101 # removes the eth1.101 interface
$ ip link set dev br-mgmt down # sets the br-mgmt bridge down
$ brctl delbr br-mgmt # deletes the br-mgmt bridge
$ brctl delif br-vxlan eth1.102 # deletes eth1.102 interface from br-vxlan
$ vconfig rem eth1.102 # removes the eth1.102 interface
$ ip link set dev br-vxlan down # sets the br-vxlan bridge down
$ brctl delbr br-vxlan # deletes the br-vxlan bridge
$ brctl delif br-storage eth1.103 # similar story as above
$ vconfig rem eth1.103
$ ip link set dev br-storage down
$ brctl delbr br-storage
```
