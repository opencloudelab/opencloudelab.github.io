## INTRODUCTION TO TENSOR FLOW

This section will guide you to get an idea about tensor flow. The course will provide you with an introduction to tensor flow, steps to install tensor flow, followed by a few practical examples that will help you understand how to define your own neural network model and activate them using tensors in tensor flow. 

## Prerequisites
Basic understanding of neural networks is assumed for this course. 

## Tensor Flow 

Tensor Flow is an open source machine learning software library used to program the numerical computations that machine learning projects deal with. The computations are represented as graphs in tensor flow. Tensor flow does computations using tensors which are multidimensional arrays/ list of values. These tensors are described by its Rank, Shape and Type. Tensor flow provides several built in functions. A few of them includes tensor transforamtions, computations, image recognition, segmentations, neural networks. In short, it is a programming system that helps you model a neural network model, train the model and also execute it.
