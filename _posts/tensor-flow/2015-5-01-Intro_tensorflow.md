## INTRODUCTION
 Tensor Flow is Google's Artificial Intelligence Engine. The tensor flow provides a platform to execute your neural network model for your application. The course objective is to provide you with an introduction to tensor flow, steps to install tensor flow, followed by a few practical examples that will help you understand how to define your own neural network model and activate them using tensors in tensor flow. 

The contents of this course is primarily based on the tutorial at www.tensorflow.org 

## Prerequisites
Basic understanding of neural networks is assumed for this course. 

## Tensor Flow 

Tensor Flow is an open source machine learning software library used to program the numerical computations that machine learning projects deal with. The computations are represented as graphs in tensor flow. Tensor flow does computations using tensors which are multidimensional arrays/ list of values. These tensors are described by its Rank, Shape and Type. Tensor flow provides several built in functions. A few of them includes tensor transforamtions, computations, image recognition, segmentations, neural networks. In short, it is a programming system that helps you model a neural network model, train the model and also execute it.
