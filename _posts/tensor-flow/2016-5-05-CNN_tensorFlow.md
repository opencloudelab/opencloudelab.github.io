Convolutional Neural Network or CNN is key towards most of the computer vision systems today and is held responsible for highly 
valued results in image classification problems. CNN in simple terms is multiple copies of the same neuron. This tutorial deals 
with basic understanding of a convolutional neural network and would also direct you to implement understand how to apply CNN to 
MNIST digit recognition task using tensor flow.
