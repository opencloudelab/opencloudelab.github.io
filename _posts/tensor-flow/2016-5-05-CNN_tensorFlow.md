title: Lab 5 Convolutional Neural Network using Tensor Flow  
categories: tensor-flow
author: Mitha Ann Philip
description: Convolutional Neural Networks are variants of multilayer perceptrons. We will apply convolutional nets to the digit recognition network model and see if it improves the accuracy of digit recognition. This lab is a practical guide focussing on applying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to the digit recognition neural network model.

## Introduction
Convolutional Neural Network or CNN is key towards most of the computer vision systems today and is held responsible for highly 
valued results in image classification problems. CNN in simple terms is multiple copies of the same neuron. This tutorial deals 
with basic understanding of a convolutional neural network and would also direct you to implement understand how to apply CNN to 
MNIST digit recognition task using tensor flow.

## Prerequisites

Knowledge in Machine Learning and also basic tensor flow.
