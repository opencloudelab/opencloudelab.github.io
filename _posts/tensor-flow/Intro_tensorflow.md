- INTRODUCTION TO TENSOR FLOW

Tensor Flow is an open source machine learning software library used to program the numerical computations that machine learning projects 
deal with. The computations are graphs in tensor flow. Deep Learning and Neural Network together works best for 
applications that involve image / speech recognition, natural language processing. This section provides an introduction to tensor flow, 
with practical examples that will help you understand how define your own neural network model and activate them using tensors in tensor 
flow.
