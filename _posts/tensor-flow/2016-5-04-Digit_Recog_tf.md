This section primarily focusses on understanding a neural network model using tensor flow. We would use the MNIST, a large dataset of 
handwritten digits for the purpose. MNIST digit recognition task is fundamental towards understanding-how to model a neural net using 
tensor flow. Our goal in this section would be to implement a neural model for the recognition process and to calculate the accuracy of 
our model.
