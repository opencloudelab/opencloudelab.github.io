## Introduction
Tensors are used to represent data in tensor flow. Computation graph uses these tensors to do the computations. There are different 
types of tensors and they can be defined using rank, shape and type. This section provides with a basic understanding of how to program 
using tensors in tensor flow. 

## Prequisites
We assume that tensor flow is installed successfully

## Example 1: 
### Welcome to Tensor Flow 
The objective of this program is to understand the basic structure of a simple tensor flow program.

##Example 2: 
### Basic Operations and Commands
The objective is to familiarize on different types of tensor that can be used in tensor flow.

## Example 3: 
### Objective of this program is to familiarize with tensor tranformation.
