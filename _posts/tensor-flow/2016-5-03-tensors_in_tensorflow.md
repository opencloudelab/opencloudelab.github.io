## Introduction
Tensors are used to represent data in tensor flow. Computation graph uses these tensors to do the computations. There are different 
types of tensors and they can be defined using rank, shape and type. This section provides with a basic understanding of how to program 
using tensors in tensor flow. 

## Prequisites
We assume that tensor flow is installed successfully

## Example 1: 
### Welcome to Tensor Flow 
A tensor flow program executes within a session. All the nodes that are created within a program is executed using the session. The output obtained will be contained within that session. The objective of this program is to understand the basic structure of a simple tensor flow program.

##Example 2: 
### Basic types of tensors and Commands
 Tensor flow allows has different types of tensors. Every node that is created in tensor flow is assigned an operation using the tensor flow commands. The objective is to familiarize on different types of tensor and also on a couple of commands in tensor flow.

## Example 3: 
### Tensors are used to do computations in tensor flow. Objective of this program is to familiarize with tensor tranformation.
