- INTRODUCTION TO CAFFE

      Machine learning data computations are really huge. Caffe is a deep learning framework where the layers are clearly defined using a model,often used for image recognition. It also addresses the hardware requirements that are to be met as a result of the increased number of neural layers and their computations. This section deals with the fundementals of Caffe and a few worked out examples to ease your understanding.
