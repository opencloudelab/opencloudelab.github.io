#### Course 5: How to use Swift? 
* * *

Since we have installed Swift in last tutorial, this section will focus on using the swift:

**We are still logged in as root on Swift Controller**

```sh
# cd  /opt/openstack-ansible/playbooks
```
```sh
# lxc-ls -f
```
Above command will generate a list of countainers, last one in the list is utility countainer.
```sh
# lxc-attach -n <Utility Countainer>
```
```sh
# source openrc
```
Now swift is ready to use, each time you login to Swift Controller, you need to perform all the above commands.

To check the status of swift.  
```sh
# swift stat
```
To list all the swift countainer
```sh
# swift list
```
To create a new countainer and upload a file
```sh
# swift upload Name_of_Container Name_of_File
```
To list all the files in a perticular countainer
```sh
# swift list Name_of_Container
```
