#### Course 1: Preparing Storage nodes for Swift. 
* * *

This video discribes 3 node installation on Bare Metal Chameleon cloud server. For our case, we designed our setup as follows:

10.40.0.124 > A Ubuntu 14.04 server as **Swift Controller** with single physical drive.  

10.40.0.121 > A Ubuntu 14.04 server as **Swift Storage 1** with 16 physical drives.  

10.40.0.123 > A Ubuntu 14.04 server as **Swift Storage 2** with 16 physical drives.

Now ssh to all 3 servers as root.  
We will create ssh key pair for password less communication between controller and storage nodes:

**Follow below steps to generate key pair on Swift Controller Node**

```sh
# ssh-keygen
```
Don't put the paraphrase for the key. (Press ENTER 3 time)

```sh
# cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
Copy the public key. Now open below mentioned file on 2 storage nodes and paste the key into the file.

```sh
# nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**Below instructions need to be followed on both the storage nodes**

```sh
# git clone https://github.com/alextricity25/cc_swift_bare_metal.git 
```

```sh
# cd cc_swift_bare_metal
```

```sh
# chmod +x make_partition.sh make_filesystem.sh make_mountpoints.sh mount_filesystem.sh 
```

**Creating Partition**

```sh
# ./make_partition.sh 
```

**Deploying File System**

```sh
# ./make_filesystem.sh 
```

**Creating Mount points**

```sh
# ./make_mountpoints.sh
```

**Mounting filesystem**

```sh
# ./mount_filesystem.sh
```
