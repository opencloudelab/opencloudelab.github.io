After cloning few github repositories, now we will edit and run yml files for controller deployment:

**We are still logged in as root on Swift controller**

If you are not in OSCAR directory, do **cd OSCAR/**

```sh
# openstack-ansible  bootstrap-controller-play.yml
```

ip a s br-mgmt (Optional step to check successful deployment of controller)

```sh
# openstack-ansible  bootstrap-computes-play.yml 
```

ip a (Optional step to check successful deployment of compute-play)

Comment compute hosts and storage hosts in below mentioned file as we not using Cinder and Glance.

```sh
# nano  /etc/openstack_deploy/openstack_user_config.yml
```

Copy swift.yml.aio file to swift.yml

```sh
# cp /etc/openstack_deploy/conf.d/swift.yml.aio  /etc/openstack_deploy/conf.d/swift.yml
```

**Configuration chnages in swift.yml file**

```sh
# for i in {a..p};  do echo - name: sd${i}1;  done; 
```

Copy the output after running above command, paste it under the drives category into the below mentioned file and delete previous entries.

```sh
# nano /etc/openstack_deploy/conf.d/swift.yml
```

We also need to **change the Part Power** in above file for optimum performance. Formula to calculate part power is **log to the base 2 (Total number of disks * 100)**. Total number of disks are nothing but the HDDs/SSDs present in Swift Storage node 1 and 2. Round off the number to nearest decimal. [Learn more about Part Power here](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/liberty/install-guide/configure-swift-config.html)


Change the mount point from **/srv** to **/srv/node** in the same file.

Now we need to entre IPs of controller and storage node in the same file.

```sh
swift-proxy_hosts:
			aiol1:
		       ip: 172.16.100.100			
swift_hosts:			
	swiftstorage1:
		       ip: 172.16.100.101		
	swiftstorage2:
	           ip: 172.16.100.102
```

**Now swift.yml file looks as below** 

```sh

global_overrides:
  swift:
    part_power: 12
    storage_network: 'br-storage'
    replication_network: 'br-storage'
    drives:

      - name: sdb1
      - name: sdc1
      - name: sdd1
      - name: sde1
      - name: sdf1
      - name: sdg1
      - name: sdh1
      - name: sdi1
      - name: sdj1

      - name: sdl1
      - name: sdm1
      - name: sdn1
      - name: sdo1
      - name: sdp1
    mount_point: /srv/node
    storage_policies:
      - policy:
          name: default
          index: 0
          default: True
swift-proxy_hosts:
  aio1:
    ip: 172.16.100.100

swift_hosts:
  swiftstorage1:
    ip: 172.16.100.101
  swiftstorage2:
    ip: 172.16.100.102
```
