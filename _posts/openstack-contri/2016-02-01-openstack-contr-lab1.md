OpenStack uses the Ubuntu One account ... fill in information here.

First, head to  [https://one.ubuntu.com]( https://one.ubuntu.com) and set up an account. 
Once done with this, check your email for a verification code and submit that code once following a link back to their website.
And now you are done with this step of the set up.
