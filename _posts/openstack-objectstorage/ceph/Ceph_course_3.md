#### Course 3: Deploying Ceph #

* * *

Deploying Ceph Packages on server :

After the reboot from last session, we are again logged in as root to 10.40.0.253 server which is our Ceph Monitor  

If you are not a root user, execute below command 

```sh
$ sudo su -
```
In last session we have partitioned the drive, now we will deploy XFS filesystem on it.    

```sh$
# mkfs.xfs -f /dev/sda1
```  
```sh$
# mkfs.xfs -f /dev/sdb1
```  
If you want to use other drives as Ceph OSD deploy filesystem on it using similar commamd.

To check if file system is deployed or not 
```sh$
# blkid
```
Make new directory for Ceph installation 
```sh$
# mkdir my-ceph
# cd my-ceph
```
Now execute below command one by one
```sh$
# yum install ceph*  -y
```
```sh$
# ceph-deploy new <hostname> 
```
```sh$
# ceph-deploy install <hostname> 
```
```sh$
# ceph-deploy mon create-initial 
```
Above command will create key pair for Ceph.

Now we need to prepare and activate the OSDs
```sh$
# ceph-deploy --overwrite-conf osd prepare <hostname>:/dev/sda1
```
```sh$
# ceph-deploy --overwrite-conf osd activate <hostname>:/dev/sda1
```
Follow same process for /dev/sdb1
```sh$
# ceph-deploy --overwrite-conf osd prepare <hostname>:/dev/sdb1
```
```sh$
# ceph-deploy --overwrite-conf osd activate <hostname>:/dev/sdb1
```
This will finish the **Ceph Deployment**

To check the ceph Health
```sh$
# ceph -s
```
Some other usefull commands for Ceph
```sh$
# ceph version
```
```sh$
# ceph osd tree
```
```sh$
# ceph mon stat
```
