- Artificial Neural Networks

  ANN or Artificial Neural Network is an information processing model, inspired by the way a human brain process information. Just as humans, a neural network is designed to learn from examples. Neural Network requires interconnected neurons to carry out the task objective. The artificial neural network is modelled for applications which involves classification or recognition tasks. 
  
  This tutorial will focus on the basics of neural network and on how to train a neural network model.
