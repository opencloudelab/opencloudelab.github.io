- Artificial Neural Networks

   Machine Learning can be used here to make the system learn from observations. Just as humans, a neural network is designed to learn from examples. Neural Network requires interconnected neurons to carry out the task objective. The artificial neural network is modelled for applications which involves classification or recognition tasks. 
  
  This tutorial will focus on the basics of neural network and on how to train a neural network model.
