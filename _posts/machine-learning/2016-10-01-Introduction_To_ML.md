- INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING

    You can make your program predict with reference to observations from the past. Machine Learning is an exciting field where your program learns and then predict results. The section focusses primarily on concepts that makes up the field of Machine Learning.  
      
    - NAIVE BAYES

      Naive Bayes classifiers works great for applications such as document classification, spam filtering. The supervised algorithms are based on the Bayes' theorem which deals with probability of an occurrence, based on conditions related to it.
      
    - SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES

      SVM or Support Vector Machines uses supervised learning method. It is used for 'yes or no' prediction (that is a classification problem), for a system which provides predicted results - helping with information on 'How much' or 'how many'(technically termed as Regression). 
      
    - DECISION TREES

      Decision Trees are easier to understand / interpret. It defines a model that uses observations from several input values and predicts the value of the target variable. The model is commonly used for classification and regression.
      
    - CLUSTERING

      Clustering uses an unsupervised learning method. It assigns the input to a subset called a cluster, which has values that are similar in some manner. A few of its applications include statistical data analysis, identification of cancer detection, search engines.
    
    - FEATURE SELECTION

      Feature selection uses the most relevant attributes from the input set. Feature selection also called as variable selection, attribute selection helps to reduce training time, simplifies your predictor model.
      
    - PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS

      Principal component analysis or PCA deals with a dimension reduction concept, where a large set of input data is reduced to its smaller version but still holds most of the information in the larger set.
