- INTRODUCTION TO TENSOR FLOW

      Tensor Flow is an open source machine learning software library used to program the numerical computations that machine learning projects deal with. The computations are graphs in tensor flow. Deep Learning and Neural Network together works best for applications that involve image / speech recognition, natural language processing. This section below includes various topics that would help you define your own neural network model, activated using tensors in tensor flow. 

      - WORKING WITH TENSOR FLOW

       This section deals with a step by step procedure to install tensor flow.      

      - TENSORS IN TENSOR FLOW 

      Tensors are used to represent data in tensor flow. Computation graph uses these tensors to do the computations. There are different types of tensors and they can be defined using rank, shape and type. This section provides with a basic understanding of how to program using tensors in tensor flow. 
    
      - DIGIT RECOGNITION USING TENSOR FLOW

      This section primarily focusses on understanding a neural network model using tensor flow. We would use the MNIST, a large dataset of handwritten digits for the purpose. MNIST digit recognition task is fundamental towards understanding-how to model a neural net using tensor flow. Our goal in this section would be to implement a neural model for the recognition process and to calculate the accuracy of our model.
      
      - CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK

      Convolutional Neural Network or CNN is key towards most of the computer vision systems today and is held responsible for highly valued results in image classification problems. CNN in simple terms is multiple copies of the same neuron. This tutorial deals with basic understanding of a convolutional neural network and would also direct you to implement understand how to apply CNN to MNIST digit recognition task using tensor flow.
      
      - DEEP LEARNING NEURAL NETWORK

      Deep neural network deals with more than 3 layers of hidden neurons. The resulting features from the hidden layer are much complex features of the input, making the prediction more accurate. This section deals with key concepts that are required for deep learning neural network.
