description: Convolutional Neural Network involves multiple layers of convolutions and is followed by the sub sampling layers. It deals with set of arrays called features as input and output. It helps generate features that are invariant to translations. This section provides an introduction to concepts on Convolutional Neural Network.

Convolutional networks are variants of multilayer perceptrons. It uses convolution on its input layer to get the output. It uses multiple layers of convolutions and applies nonlinear activation functions such as tanh or ReLu to the result obtained. A CNN learns the values for the filters during the learning phase.

This tutorial will help in the understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks.
