Convolutional networks are variants of multilayer perceptrons. It uses convolution on its input layer to get the output. It uses multiple layers of convolutions and applies nonlinear activation functions such as tanh or ReLu to the result obtained. A CNN learns the values for the filters during the learning phase.

This tutorial will help in the understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks.
