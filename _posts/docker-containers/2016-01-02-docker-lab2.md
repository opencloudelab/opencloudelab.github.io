#### We followed, abridged, and skipped around the guide laid out at: 
[https://docs.docker.com/](https://docs.docker.com/)
 
### Step 1: Chameleon Resources Log In
Create 2 Chameleon baremetal servers. We used an Ubuntu 14 image for this tutorial but feel free to use any other Distro as long it runs Docker. 
Docker requires a 64-bit installation regardless of your Ubuntu version. Additionally, your kernel must be 3.10 at minimum.
Log into your machine as a **sudo** or **root** user. 
```sh
ssh  <yourip>
```
To check your current kernel version, use uname -r to display your kernel version:
```sh
uname -r
```
### Step 2: Update Package Information
```sh
sudo apt-get update
```
Ensure that APT works with the https method, and that CA certificates are installed.
```sh
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates
```

### Step 3: Add the new GPG Key
```sh
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D
```

### Step 4: Editing Sources list
```sh
sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list 
```

### Step 5: Update the **APT** package index.
```sh
sudo apt-get update
```

### Step 6: Verify that APT is pulling from the right repository.
```sh
apt-cache policy docker-engine
```
From now on, APT pulls from new repository.
