description: In this tutorial you will be setting up a website. You will be using two hosts for this tutorial. This is part one of the tutorial on Host 1.

#### We followed, abridged, and skipped around the guide laid out at: 
[https://docs.docker.com/](https://docs.docker.com/)

## Running Containers using Docker 
In this tutorial, you will be setting up one host with a Postgres (SQL database) container. The other host will be setup with Nginx (web server) and uWGSI (interface to Python script that generates actual page) containers. To connect the uWGSI
container across hosts to the Postgres container we will use _ambassador_ containers, one on each host.

### Step 1: Chameleon Resources
Create 2 Chameleon baremetal servers. We used a CentOS 7 image for this tutorial but feel free to use any other Distro as long it runs Docker. 

### Step 2: Container Set Up
You have two options to deploy the containers. You can pull already built containers from our Docker Hub [https://hub.docker.com/u/cloudandbigdatalab/](https://hub.docker.com/u/cloudandbigdatalab/) repos and run them. Or you can pull this GitHub repo and build the Docker images yourself using the Dockerfile in each directory.

#### Host 1:
##### Pulling from Docker Hub:
Start postgres container. Port 5432 is set to be exposed in Dockerfile. -d run as daemon (run in background). user: cloudandbigdatalab, repo: postgres 
``` sh
sudo docker run --name postgres -d cloudandbigdatalab/postgres
```
Start ambassador container, linking to postgres, -p map port 5432 from within container to outside.
``` sh
sudo docker run --name host2_ambassador -d --link postgres:postgres -p 5432:5432 svendowideit/ambassador 
```
##### Building from Dockerfile:

Clone Repository
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/cloudandbigdatalab/tutorial-cham-docker-1.git
```

Move to postgres directory
``` sh
cd postgres
```

Build postgres image
``` sh
sudo docker build -t postgres
```
